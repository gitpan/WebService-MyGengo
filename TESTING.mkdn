# Testing

## Testing with mock objects
 1. By default, all tests run using WebService::MyGengo::Test::Mock::LWP, a mocked LWP::UserAgent

## Live Sandbox Testing
 1. Open t/lib/WebService/MyGengo/Test/Util/Config.pm in a text editor
 1. Enter your sandbox public and private keys and save the file
 * Because some tests require Jobs of particular statuses, several test
     classes will create test Jobs for you and ask you to modify them in the
     sandbox web interface. That is why there are 2 test runs below:
 1. `prove -I t/lib -I lib t/*.t :: --live 1`
 1. Follow the instructions in the test output
 1. `prove -I t/lib -I lib t/*.t :: --live 2`
